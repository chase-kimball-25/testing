## Troubleshooting

### App Not Loading
- Make sure you're opening `index.html` in a modern browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Check that all files are in the same folder

### Camera/Photo Features Not Working
- **This is normal when opening files directly**
- Camera access requires HTTPS (secure connection)
- The photo upload simulation will still work for demo purposes
- Click photo areas to see "Image captured" confirmation

### Mobile Testing Issues
- Try opening the files through a cloud storage service
- Some mobile browsers may block local file access
- Use Chrome or Safari on mobile for best compatibility

### Permission Prompts Not Appearing
- **This is expected when running from files**
- The permission screens are for demo/testing purposes
- Click through the permission flow to reach the main app

### JavaScript Errors
- Open browser developer tools (F12) to check for errors
- Make sure all files are in the same directory
- Ensure no browser extensions are blocking the script
